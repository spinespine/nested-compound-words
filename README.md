# Nested Compound Word Finder
This Java program looks through a list of words in a dictionary to find nested compound words and their parts.

## What is a nested compound word?

A nested compound word is a word that can have a smaller word removed from its interior such that the remaining letters concatonate to form a different word. I coined the term in October 2023.

An example is *reward:* remove the word *war* from its center, and the remainng letters *re* and *d* concatonate to form the word *red.*

Another example is *fragile.* Remove the word *rag* from its center, and the remainng letters *f* and *ile* concatonate to form the word *file.*
